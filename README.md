* Pre-draw columns during loading (and remove if fails)
* Pre-fetch data on page
* Add options page
* Expand RB flyout to show receiving numbers next to rushing numbers.

####Idea log: 
* Style modifications to tabs above with "videos" etc so they're not so ugly.

* Move player "more stats" into tabs and name them properly.
* Show collective injury data  from previous year(P, Q, O, IR designations) Maybe next to week column.
